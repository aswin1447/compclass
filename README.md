## Computational Physics

Welcome to computational physics! This is the repository with the [syllabus](./syllabus/computational.md), [problem sets](./problems), and [lectures](./classes). Other useful links:

### Topics and links

These links open a static nbviewer. You can also open binder by clicking [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/henryiii/compclass/master?urlpath=lab) - this may take quite a while to load the first time someone clicks it after a new commit to the repository.
